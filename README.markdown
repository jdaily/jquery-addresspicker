jquery-addresspicker for Bootstrap
==================================

I forked this project from elmariachi111[https://github.com/elmariachi111/jquery-addresspicker] who has built a simple address picker on top of JQuery UI Autocomplete. Using his work as the basis, I've updated to work with twitter's typeahead, which will soon replace bootstrap's typeahead in Bootstrap 3.0

Seeing is believing. [Hosted on AWS S3](http://mngscl-10.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/jquery-addresspicker-bootstrap/demos/index.html), if it's broken and you need it, drop me a line. 
Otherwise: just clone the repo and open demos/index.html on your local machine...

Simple Addresspicker
--------------------
The addresspicker is a plain JQuery plugin and follows mostly concepts known to Bootstrap users. I'm using Bootstrap typeahead filled by anonymous google map geocoder suggestions.
Try to enter an address like Berlin Kreuzberg, Manhattan Central Park or London Soho and you'll see suggests

    var addresspicker = $( "#addresspicker" ).addresspicker();

Addresspicker with Map
----------------------
![Addresspicker with Map](https://github.com/elmariachi111/jquery-addresspicker/blob/master/demos/images/addresspicker.jpg?raw=true)

You can drag and drop the marker to the correct location. The input field address is then updated again according to a reverse Geocoding result. 
Note that I'm using JQuery events to notify you on address and marker position changes

    var addresspickerMap = $( "#addresspicker_map" ).addresspicker(
        {
            regionBias: "de",
            map:      "#map_canvas",
            typeaheaddelay: 1000,
            mapOptions: {
                zoom:16,
                center: new google.maps.LatLng(52.5122, 13.4194)
            }
        });

        addresspickerMap.on("addressChanged", function(evt, address) {
           alert(address.geometry.location.lat() +"," + address.geometry.location.lng());
           console.dir(address); //do something with the address. It's a Google Geocoder result
        });

        //markerPosition is a LatLng that I augmented with an getAddress function for convenience
        //getAddress triggers a reverse geocode request.

        addresspickerMap.on("positionChanged", function(evt, markerPosition) {
            markerPosition.getAddress( function(address) {
                if (address) { //address is a Google Geocoder result
                    $( "#addresspicker_map").val(address.formatted_address);
                }
            })
        });
    });

Features to notice
------------------
Twitter's typeahead doesn't support computed datasets, a category that the google maps API falls under.
I used a modified version ([pull request is pending](https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/pull/220") of twitter's typeahead with a compute function.
Here are some things to note:

* **Slightly modifed CSS** to support bootstrap's css. Here:[https://github.com/jharding/typeahead.js-bootstrap.css]

Usage / Download
----------------
Make sure, you have included the Google Maps Javascript API: 
`<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false"></script>` The only dependency is Bootstrap.css and the modified Bootstrap Typeahead JQuery plugin (lib)

Open
----
**throttled or debounce lookups** Currently not working. twitter typeahead supports it, not sure about the compute pull. Will get to that soon.

Closed (FAQ)
------------
Q: When the Addresspicker is loaded inside an invisible container the map view is broken / displays strangely after the container is shown.

A: After unhiding a Google map container you have to trigger a *resize event* to force the map to redraw (see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4340975/google-maps-loading-strangely )
In our case it's sufficient to call the `reloadPosition` function on the plugin:

`$addressPicker.addresspicker('reloadPosition')`
